# NETFLIX Data Analysis(Python + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **OTT (Over-the-Top) streaming platform data**, specifically from Netflix, using **Python for data cleaning & analysis** and **Power BI for data visualization**. 
The goal is to extract insights into streaming trends, content availability, and genre distributions in TV Shows and Movies that has been available in Netflix over the years. 

The datasets that are required i.e. the original dataset and the cleaned dataset which will be used further in Power BI are available in the **Dataset** Folder.

## 📊 Features
- **Python Data Cleaning & Processing**: Uses `pandas` and `numpy` to clean and prepare Netflix dataset.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard visualizing content distribution, trends, and insights.
- **Genre & Category Analysis**: Breakdown of content by type, genre, and country.
- **Time-Based Insights**: Trend analysis of content releases over the years.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI**
